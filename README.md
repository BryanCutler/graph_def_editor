# pge: Portable Graph Editor
### A port of the old TensorFlow `contrib.graph_editor` to use public APIs

TensorFlow versions prior to version 2.0 had a Python graph editor in
`contrib.graph_editor`. This functionality was removed in TensorFlow 2.0.
This project brings back the graph editor as a standalone Python package.

Unlike the original graph editor, this package depends only on public APIs of
TensorFlow. The editor uses the SavedModel format for both input and output.
